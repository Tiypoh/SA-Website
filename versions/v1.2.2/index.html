				<h3>About</h3>
					<p>Are you looking for an auto mechanic near me? Open now Sebring Automotive is Tucson and Southern Arizona's new mechanic solution. Sebring Automotive was started by me, Kyle Sebring, I always have done my own mechanic work, and never paid a shop to do it for me, I got a job at a BMW dealership as a technician but when I saw the prices that even small shops like the one I was working at charge, I had to do something.</p>
					<button class="about toggle display" data-section="about">Read More</button>
					<p class="about hidden">Sebring Automotive charges only $80/hour, and lower parts markup than any other shop. We believe in you getting your car fixed for a fair price, as a small shop we dont need to make large profit margins off of you to support a large overhead cost, we keep things small and simple, while still having the capacity to handle most all of your jobs, and with the same if not better skill than any other shop in town.</p>
					<p class="about hidden">I've always wanted to run a business, and I've always loved working on cars, so I knew I had to open my own mechanic shop, especially since I had access to my Dad's old shop from working on street sweepers for his own business, Sunrise Exterior LLC., which he closed down in 2020. Since then I've completely cleaned and revamped the shop for automotive mechanic work, we are set up to do almost any job from oil changes to engine swaps.</p>
					<p class="about hidden">While I love working on cars in general, to be honest with you my true passion is performance work. We are able to do all bolt on modifications, and even most custom jobs, including fabrication and 3D modeling. We can make your dreams come true, tell us what you want from your car and we will make it happen, we can give you one of Tucson's finest ride - if you got the cash. Our performance work runs slightly more, but still an affordable $100/hour</p>
