							<h3>Oil Changes</h3>
								<p>We offer a flat rate $80 for premium synthetic oil changes!</p>
								<button class="oil toggle display" data-section="oil">Read More</button>
								<p class="oil hidden">Your car deserves the best, so our standard oil change uses the local brand Silver State full synthetic oil, one of the best mixes for daily driving to keep your car running right. Our oil changes start at $80 for any passenger car (trucks and diesels exempt), however we are able to source any upgraded oils and filters at your request. We use an advanced pneumatic extractor to suction your oil and guarantee zero mess.</p>

							<h3>Restoration</h3>
								<p>Do you have a classic car that nobody is familiar with anymore? We specialize in restoration and restomodding!</p>
								<button class="classics toggle display" data-section="classics">Read More</button>
								<p class="classics hidden">We love classic cars and restoration work, bringing pieces of history back to life. My own cars are an '89 MR2 SC and a '79 Jaguar with a '69 Camaro SS motor, classics are my favorite to work on, and we can "restomod" them to have modern touches while keeping the classic design.</p>

								<button class="laborrate toggle display" data-section="laborrate">Read More</button>
								<p class="laborrate hidden">Sebring Automotive offers a very competitive $80/hour labor rate, in a world where no shop charges less than $100/hour and most dealerships ask you to fork out over $200 for an hour of their time. And if you find a better deal than us, send us a picture of your estimate from another shop and we will match the price or better!</p>
